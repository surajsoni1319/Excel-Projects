# Excel-Projects

This Excel project utilizes the FILTER function to dynamically display employee records based on the selected department. The dataset contains columns for Employee ID, Name, Country, Gender, and Department. A drop-down list is created in cell L1, allowing users to choose a department. 

The formula: =FILTER(A2:E79,E2:E79=L1)
automatically retrieves and displays all rows where the department matches the selected value. This interactive filtering approach makes it easier to view and analyze specific departmental data without manually adjusting the dataset.
